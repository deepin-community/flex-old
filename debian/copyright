This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged old version of flex, the GNU lexical
analyzer generator.

This package was first put together by Robert Leslie <rob@mars.org>.
It is currently maintained by Tommi Vainikainen <tvainika@debian.org>,
who took over from Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>,
who took over from Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>, 
and it is built from sources obtained from:

http://flex.sourceforge.net/
